Welcome to set calculator!

You can do 11 operations:
    1. show {id}: shows all elements of the give set
    2. add {id} {number1} {number2} ...: add given numbers to given set
    3. aredisjoint {id1} {id2}: checks if giiven sets are disjoint
    4. issubset {id1} {id2}: checks if first set is subset of second set
    5. union {id1} {id2} {id3}: writes the result of union beteween to sets to third set
    6. intersection {id1} {id2} {id3}: writes the result of intersection beteween to sets to third set
    7. difference {id1} {id2} {id3}: writes the result of difference beteween to sets to third set
    8. size {id}: shows size of give set
    9. contains {id} {number}: checks if number belong to set
